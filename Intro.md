### Loading packages
The R scripts rely on the data.table package. If this is not installed, you will need to run the following:
  install.packages("data.table")
  library(data.table)
### Loading data
The data is available in zip format at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
Before running the scripts unzip the contents (household_power_consumption.txt file) to this directory, then set your working directory to this one.
